# 🏴‍☠️ Treasure Island – Python Adventure Game

This is a simple text-based adventure game created as part of the **"100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp"** by [Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).  
The player makes choices at different stages to try and find the hidden treasure.

## 📌 Description

**Treasure Island** is a beginner-friendly Python project where the player explores an island through a series of decisions. Some choices lead to danger, while only the correct path leads to the treasure. It's a great exercise in using conditional statements and `input()` in Python.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3

## 💡 Features

- Text-based user interaction via the terminal
- Decision-based storytelling using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Multiple endings: success or game over
